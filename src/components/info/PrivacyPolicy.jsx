                11. Your Rights in Respect of Personal Data About You <br/>
                You are entitled to the following rights in respect of Personal Data about you. The exercise of such
                rights will be by contacting Us via social networks. <br/>
                Right of access <br/>
                You have the right to receive from Us confirmation as to whether or not Personal Data about you is being
                processed, and, where that is the case, access to the Personal Data and the following information: (1)
                the purposes of the processing; (2) the categories of Personal Data concerned; (3) the recipients or
                categories of recipients to whom the Personal Data has been or will be disclosed, in particular, if you
                are in the European Union, recipients in third countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or
                international organizations; (4) where possible, the envisaged period for which the Personal Data will
                be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; (5) the existence of the
                right to request from Us rectification or erasure of Personal Data or restriction of processing of
                Personal Data about you or to object to such processing; (6) if you are in the European Union - the
                right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; (7) where the Personal Data is not collected
                from you, any available information as to its source; (8) the existence of profiling; and (9) if you are
                in the European Union - where Personal Data is transferred to a third country outside the EEA or to an
                international organization, the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer. <br/>
                We shall provide a copy of the Personal Data undergoing processing and may charge a reasonable fee for
                any further copies requested by you. Where you make the request by electronic means, and unless
                otherwise requested by you, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form. <br/>
                The right to obtain a copy of the Personal Data shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of
                others, and therefore if the request will harm the rights and freedoms of others, We may not fulfill
                your request or do so in a limited manner. <br/>
                Right to rectification <br/>
                You have the right to obtain from Us the rectification of inaccurate Personal Data about you. Taking
                into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete Personal Data
                completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement. <br/>
                Right to erasure <br/>
                You have the right to obtain from Us the erasure of Personal Data about you where one of the following
                grounds applies: (a) the Personal Data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it
                was collected or otherwise processed; (b) you withdraw your consent on which the processing is based and
                there is no other legal ground for the processing; (c) you object at any time, on grounds relating to
                your particular situation, to processing of Personal Data about you which is based on the legitimate
                interests pursued by Us or by a third party, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the
                processing; (d) the Personal Data has been unlawfully processed; (e) the Personal Data about you has to
                be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in European Union or Member State law to which We are
                subject. <br/>
                This right is not applicable to the extent that the processing is necessary: (a) for compliance with a
                legal obligation which requires processing by law to which We are subject; or (b) for the establishment,
                exercise or defense of legal claims. <br/>
                Right of restriction of processing <br/>
                You have the right to obtain from Us the restriction of processing of Personal Data about you where one
                of the following applies: (a) the accuracy of the Personal Data is contested by you, for a period
                enabling Us to verify the accuracy of the Personal Data about you; (b) the processing is unlawful and
                you oppose the erasure of the Personal Data about you and request the restriction of its use instead;
                (c) We no longer need the Personal Data about you for the purposes of the processing, but it is required
                by you for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; (d) where the processing of Personal
                Data about you is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by Us or by a third
                party, unless We demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your
                interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. <br/>
                Where processing of Personal Data about you has been restricted following your request, such Personal
                Data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed with your consent or for the establishment,
                exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal
                person or for reasons of important public interest. <br/>
                Right to data portability <br/>
                You have the right to receive the Personal Data about you, which you have provided to Us, in a
                structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit such Personal Data
                to another controller, where: (a) the processing is based on your consent or on a contract to which you
                are a party; and (b) the processing is carried out by automated means. <br/>
                In exercising your right to data portability, you have the right to have the Personal Data about you
                transmitted directly from Us to another controller, where technically feasible. The exercise of your
                right to data portability is without prejudice to your and Our rights under your right to erasure. In
                addition, the right to data portability shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
                <br/>
                Right to object <br/>
                You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to
                processing of Personal Data about you which is based on the legitimate interests pursued by Us or by a
                third party, including profiling based on such legitimate interests. We shall no longer process the
                Personal Data about you unless We demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which
                override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
                claims. <br/>
                Right to withdraw consent <br/>
                You may withdraw your consent provided to Us for the purpose of processing Personal Data about you at
                any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. <br/>
                Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority <br/>
                If you are in the European Union, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
                which is established by a Member State in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of
                natural persons in relation to processing of personal data within the European Union. <br/>
                <br/>
                Your rights in respect of Personal Data about you as outlined in this section 11 may be restricted by
                European Union or Member State law to which We are subject. <br/>
                We shall provide you with the information requested according to your rights outlined in this section 11
                without undue delay and in any event within 1 (one) month of receipt of the request. That period may be
                extended by 2 (two) further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the
                requests. We shall inform you of any such extension within 1 (one) month of receipt of the request,
                together with the reasons for the delay. <br/>
                The information requested according to your rights outlined in this section 11 shall be provided free of
                charge, unless stated otherwise in this section 11. Where requests are manifestly unfounded or
                excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, We may either: (a) charge a reasonable
                fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking
                the action requested; or (b) refuse to act on the request. <br/>
                We may require you to provide additional information necessary to confirm your identity in order to
                fulfill your request according to your rights outlined in this section 11, where We have reasonable
                doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request. <br/>
                <br/>
                12. Retention of Personal Data About You <br/>
                We shall retain Personal Data about you for as long as is required to fulfill the purposes of the
                processing of the Personal Data as outlined in this Policy, or for a longer period as required according
                to the legislation, regulation, policies and orders that apply to Us. <br/>
                In order to ensure that Personal Data about you is not retained for longer than is required, We
                periodically review Personal Data retained by Us in order to examine whether any Personal Data can be
                erased. <br/>
                <br/>
                13. Transfers of Personal Data to A Third Country or An International Organization <br/>
                If you are in the European Union, Data about you may be transferred to a third country (i.e.,
                jurisdictions outside the EU Member States, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein) or to international
                organizations. In such circumstances, We shall take appropriate safeguards aimed to ensure the
                protection of Personal Data about you and provide that enforceable data subject rights and effective
                legal remedies for data subjects are available. <br/>
                You may request Us to be provided with details concerning the safeguards employed by Us to protect the
                Personal Data about you which is transferred to a third country or an international organization, by
                contacting Us via social networks. <br/>
                <br/>
                14. Protection of Personal Data About You <br/>
                We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of
                security to Personal Data taking into account the risks that are presented by processing, in particular
                from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to
                Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. <br/>
                We may be required, due to legal or other obligations outside Our control, to transfer Personal Data
                about you to third parties, such as public authorities. In such circumstances, We have limited control
                over the level of protection provided to the Personal Data about you by such third parties. <br/>
                Any transfer of Personal Data via the internet cannot be fully secured. Therefore, We cannot ensure the
                protection of Personal Data about you when transferred via the internet to the Site. <br/>
                <br/>
                15. Changes to This Policy <br/>
                We may amend, from time to time, the terms of this Policy. Whenever We amend this Policy, We will notify
                such amendments by publishing the updated Policy on the Site. Unless stated otherwise, all amendments
                will enter into force upon publishing the updated Policy on the Site.
